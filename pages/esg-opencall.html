<h2>Open Call for ESG Members</h2>

<p>
Storage4Grid will publicly release a large amount of outcomes, results and lessons learned, aiming at helping the broader community of interested stakeholders in maximizing the uptake and diffusion of intelligent storage systems, thus helping society in better exploiting available Renewable Energy Sources (RES).
</p>

<p>
The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/esg.html">External Stakeholders Group</a> plays a key role in ensuring that project results are relevant for all interested parties and society as a whole, by allowing representatives of key stakeholders in influencing the strategic and technical directions of the project.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally, ESG members shall belong to one or more of the following categories:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>representatives of industries providing <strong>storage solutions</strong></li>
	<li>representatives of industries providing <strong>smart grid systems, tools and solutions</strong> related to storage.</li>
	<li>active participants of <strong>standardization initiatives</strong> related to use of Storage in the Smart Grid </li>
	<li>experts in <strong>metering</strong></li> 
	<li>representatives from <strong>energy utilities</strong> interested in energy storage solutions</li>
	<li>representatives from <strong>industries and businesses</strong> interested in evaluating and adopting energy storage solutions</li>
	<li>representatives from <strong>industries and businesses</strong> interested in <strong>new applications</strong> involving intelligent, coordinated energy storage solutions</li>
	<li>experts and representatives of associations related to <strong>privacy issues</strong> and <strong>protection of personal data.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
	ESG members support the project externally and free of charge, mostly by providing feedback on project results of interest and participating to a limited number of on-line webinars and conference calls.
</p>

<p>
	A minimum of two physical ESG meetings will be organized by the project, inviting, among all ESG members, a selection of experts which is most suitable to help on the specific topics of each workshop. While ESG participation is free-of-charge, the project will refund travel/living costs to allow ESG members to attend physical meetings.
</p>

<p>
