The [Storage4Grid](http://www.storage4grid.eu/) project has officially started on December 1st, 2016. This is an ambitious Research and Innovation Action funded by the European Commission within the framework of the [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.

Storage4Grid responds to the challenge proposed by the [LCE-01-2016](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/lce-01-2016-2017.html) call on *Next generation innovative technologies enabling smart grids, storage and energy system integration with increasing share of renewables: distribution network*, and more specifically to the needs of Area 1 (2016) - Storage, which asks for new, innovative technologies for the storage of energy in the distribution network and their integration and exploitation in the smart grid context, including decentralised storage at user premises or at substation level, encompassing optimal use of the potential of electric vehicles with particular attention on cost, stability and lifetime.

Storage4Grid aims at boosting the uptake of **storage technologies** between the distribution grid level and the end-user level, by developing a novel, **holistic methodology** for **modeling, planning, integrating, operating and evaluating distributed Energy Storage Systems**. The Storage4Grid methodology encompasses storage at user premises and storage at substation level, Electrical Vehicles, innovative energy metering and energy routing technologies.

The [Storage4Grid consortium]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/partners.html) is led by [Istituto Superiore Mario Boella sulle Tecnologie dell’Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni](http://www.ismb.it) and involves a mix of research organizations ([Universitatea Politehnica din Bucuresti](http://www.upb.ro), [Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V.](https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de), 
[Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias](http://www.uninova.pt)), two energy utilities ( [Eniig Forsyning A/S](https://www.energimidt.dk) and [Edyna S.r.l](http://www.edyna.net)) and one provider of Battery Management Solutions ([Lithium Balance A/S](http://www.lithiumbalance.com)).
