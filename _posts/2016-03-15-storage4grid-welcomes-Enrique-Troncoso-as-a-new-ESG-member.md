The Storage4Grid project has officially appointed another new member of the External Stakeholder Group (ESG). He is:

- Enrique Troncoso ([Systeng Consulting](http://www.systengconsulting.com/))

Enrique Troncoso has worked with energy storage technologies and their implementation on grid and microgrid applications for over 15 years, and has developed and led several R&D and demonstration projects in this area, including techno-economic analyses and development of business cases for implementation of energy storage technologies into grid applications (e.g. provision of ancillary services).

ESG members will play a key role in keeping the Storage4Grid vision aligned with the strategies of storage providers and the opportunities raising from new developments in Energy Storage technologies and systems.
